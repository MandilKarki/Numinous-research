This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on creating and refining intelligent agents that utilize the advanced capabilities of LLMs for a variety of applications, including natural language understanding, decision-making, and autonomous interactions. The aim is to harness the power of LLMs to create agents that are not only responsive and adaptive but also capable of complex reasoning and contextual understanding in diverse scenarios.


Hugging Face Agents: Exploring the capabilities of Hugging Face's extensive library for building and deploying LLM-based agents, known for their ease of use and versatility.

Microsoft Autogen: Delving into the advanced autoregressive text generation techniques offered by Microsoft, aimed at enhancing the interactive and generative aspects of LLM agents.

LangChain Agents: Investigating the LangChain framework for constructing agents that combine language models with knowledge retrieval and reasoning, pushing the boundaries of what LLM agents can achieve
