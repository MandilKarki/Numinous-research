Fastgen - DeepSpeed FastGen, part of Microsoft's DeepSpeed suite, is a tool designed to optimize the text generation process in large language models (LLMs). It significantly enhances efficiency by reducing memory usage and latency, enabling faster, cost-effective model deployment. Notably scalable, FastGen excels in multi-GPU environments, making it ideal for high-demand applications. As an open-source solution, it integrates seamlessly with DeepSpeed's other features, such as model parallelism, to offer a robust, adaptable framework for a wide range of AI applications, from conversational AI to complex content generation.

DeepSpeed MII (Model Implementations for Inference) is an extension of the DeepSpeed library, focused on optimizing inference tasks for deep learning models. It supports a wide range of transformer models and tasks, including text generation, question-answering, and text classification. MII is compatible with models based on BERT, RoBERTa, GPT, OPT, and BLOOM architectures. It features key optimizations such as DeepFusion for Transformers, Multi-GPU Inference with Tensor-Slicing, INT8 Inference with ZeroQuant, and ZeRO-Inference for resource-constrained systems, aiming to reduce latency and improve throughput. DeepSpeed MII allows for both on-premises and Azure cloud deployments, offering significant improvements in latency and cost for inferencing large-scale models.
